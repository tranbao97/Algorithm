# Algorithm
These are common algorithms with specific topics

Improtant point:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>    => It includes all the needed library
#define int long long       => It defind int is long long type => help us with the exercise which has the long number
int32_t main()              => main function to return int type => then we need to modified it

ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);   => turn of the sync between input and output => increase read and write
cout.tie(NULL);                     => cin thread does not sync with cout thread
cin.tie(NULL);                      => cin thread does not sync with cout thread
